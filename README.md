# URL Preview API

To accomplish the task of creating an endpoint that accepts a URL, retrieves webpage content, extracts relevant metadata, generates a preview snippet including the page title, description, and thumbnail image, and returns the structured preview data for use in link sharing and embedding, the following plan is proposed based on the information gathered and tools available:

1. **Tech Stack**:
- Programming Language: Python
- API Framework: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: Prisma

2. **Requirements Summary**:
- High accuracy and efficiency in extracting text, images, and other media while preserving the original structure.
- Supports various content types across different web technologies.
- Extracts important metadata accurately such as keywords, descriptions, authorship, publication dates, and provides options for content localization.
- Handles dynamic content loaded with JavaScript.
- Scalable, with robust error handling and ease of integration into existing systems.
- Custom extraction rules to accommodate special needs.

3. **Solution Approach**:
- Utilize the 'Requests' library for retrieving webpage content.
- Implement 'Beautiful Soup' for parsing HTML content and extracting text, images, and other media.
- Use 'Scrapy' for more comprehensive web scraping needs, handling dynamic JavaScript-loaded content, and efficient crawling of required metadata.
- Leverage HTML parsing libraries, with particular attention to meta tags like Open Graph (OG) tags, Twitter Cards, for extracting metadata that aids in generating preview snippets.
- Incorporate server-side rendering techniques for single-page applications to ensure metadata is accessible.
- Validate extracted metadata for accuracy and completeness.
- Adhere to respectful web scraping guidelines, including obeying robots.txt directives and rate limiting requests.

4. **Challenges & Considerations**:
- Ensuring the accuracy of metadata extraction is prioritized over the speed of retrieval and processing.
- Regularly updating extraction logic to adapt to changes in web technologies.
- Maintaining privacy and security in handling extracted data.

5. **Example Target URLs**: Consumer forums, product review sites (e.g., Capterra, G2 Crowd), and industry news portals (e.g., TechCrunch, Wired).

6. **Best Practices**:
- Utilizing meta tags for consistent and accurate information.
- Employing HTML parsing libraries for metadata extraction, handling exceptions gracefully.
- Validating extracted metadata, providing fallbacks where necessary, ensuring user privacy, and updating extraction logic regularly.

This comprehensive plan outlines the technology, strategies, and considerations necessary to develop a reliable and efficient tool for webpage content retrieval and metadata extraction. It's designed to meet the specific needs and priorities of the user, focusing on accuracy, scalability, and ease of integration.

## What you'll need to run this
* An unzipper (usually shipped with your OS)
* A text editor
* A terminal
* Docker
  > Docker is only needed to run a Postgres database. If you want to connect to your own
  > Postgres instance, you may not have to follow the steps below to the letter.


## How to run 'URL Preview API'

1. Unpack the ZIP file containing this package

2. Adjust the values in `.env` as you see fit.

3. Open a terminal in the folder containing this README and run the following commands:

    1. `poetry install` - install dependencies for the app

    2. `docker-compose up -d` - start the postgres database

    3. `prisma generate` - generate the database client for the app

    4. `prisma db push` - set up the database schema, creating the necessary tables etc.

4. Run `uvicorn project.server:app --reload` to start the app

## How to deploy on your own GCP account
1. Set up a GCP account
2. Create secrets: GCP_EMAIL (service account email), GCP_CREDENTIALS (service account key), GCP_PROJECT, GCP_APPLICATION (app name)
3. Ensure service account has following permissions: 
    Cloud Build Editor
    Cloud Build Service Account
    Cloud Run Developer
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Consumer
    Storage Object Viewer
4. Remove on: workflow, uncomment on: push (lines 2-6)
5. Push to master branch to trigger workflow
